## Overview

**Mathildaviz** is an interactive data visualisation project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to explore the psychological and financial challenges faced by university students in Australia.

The project — titled **"Tipping Point: The Hidden Cost of Growing Up"** — blends storytelling with statistical data to show how excitement, anxiety, cost of living, and mental health intersect throughout the student experience.

## Themes & Storyline

Each section represents a stage in the emotional and economic journey of young adulthood:

1. **Transition** — The anticipation and duality of excitement and anxiety before university begins.  
2. **Reality** — The cost of independence and the pressures of financial survival.  
3. **Strain** — How mental health and money intertwine.  
4. **Crisis** — The breaking point caused by housing pressures.  
5. **Survival** — The student economy of overwork and burnout.  
6. **Light** — The path to recovery through support, community, and connection.

## Data Highlights

- **Excitement vs Anxiety Chart:** 78% of students feel excited about university, yet 42% feel anxious before it begins.  
- **Optimism Index (2010–2025):** A 15-year decline in student optimism correlating with rising living costs.  
- **Dual-Axis Chart (Rent vs Distress):** As rent climbs from $350 → $640 per week, psychological distress doubles.  
- **Sleep vs Income Box Plot:** Sleep inequality mirrors financial inequality — rest becomes a privilege.  
- **Rent/Income Ratio Map:** Over 50% of student income in major cities goes to rent.  
- **Support Uptake Chart:** Access to counselling and community programs halves distress levels.  

Each visualisation translates quantitative data into an emotional narrative, revealing how economics and wellbeing are inseparable.
