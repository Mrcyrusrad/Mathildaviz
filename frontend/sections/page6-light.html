    <p>
      After all the strain, recovery begins with connection.
      Support, structure, and small acts of care help rebuild what stress dismantled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light returns not through luck, but through community — a friend who listens, a counsellor who validates, a system that adapts.

      <h3>Bar Chart – Uptake of Support Programs</h3>
      <p>
        These bars show growing awareness: more students are using campus counselling, peer mentoring, and online therapy.
        Uptake is strongest among those who previously reported the highest distress — proof that help works when it's accessible.

      <h3>Network Diagram – Wellbeing Correlations</h3>
      <p>
        The network view illustrates the ecosystem of recovery.
        Sleep, exercise, social support, and financial aid all connect to a single hub: wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stronger the connections, the greater the emotional stability.
        Healing isn't linear — it's relational.

      <h3>Area Chart – Improved Mood (2020–2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Over five years, the percentage of students reporting improved mood nearly doubles — from 35% to 55%.
        This is the outcome of collective care, institutional reform, and individual courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upward slope isn't just data — it's hope quantified.
