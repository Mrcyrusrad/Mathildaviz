  <!-- Intro Header -->

    <p>
      Housing instability is the silent epidemic beneath student life.
      Many are one missed payment away from relocation or homelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The places meant to feel safe — rentals, share houses, student apartments — often become sources of constant anxiety.
      Insecure housing isn't just about walls and roofs; it's about peace, privacy, and belonging.

      <h3>Map – % Income Spent on Rent</h3>
      <p>
        The map reveals an uncomfortable truth: in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, students spend over 50% of income on rent.
        Financially, this is unsustainable; emotionally, it's devastating.

      <p>
        Each shaded region isn't just data — it's a lived story of compromise, couch-surfing, or staying in overcrowded flats.

      <h3>Marimekko – Shared Housing vs Distress</h3>

        This visualization combines space and stress.
        As shared housing percentages rise, distress levels follow.

        Sharing spaces brings community — but also chaos. Privacy disappears, and small conflicts amplify existing anxieties.

      <h3>Tree Map – Housing Type Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        The housing tree map shows how fragmented the student experience is: share houses dominate, solo living is rare, and on-campus housing is inaccessible to many.

        Each block tells a story of compromise — trading security for affordability.
