  <h2 class="fade-in">The Strain: Mental Health and Money</h2>

  <!-- Intro Header -->
  <div class="intro-header fade-in">
    <p>
      What begins as financial worry soon becomes emotional fatigue.
      Constantly calculating how to stretch a dollar rewires the mind into survival mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students under chronic cost-of-living stress describe feeling "stuck in a loop" — tired but unable to rest, busy but never caught up.
      Mental health data confirms what lived experience already knows: economic strain and psychological distress rise together.

      <h3>Dual-Axis Line – Rent vs Distress</h3>
      <p>
        This chart visualizes how rent prices and mental distress rise hand-in-hand.
        As housing costs climb, the proportion of students reporting "very high distress" increases almost identically.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two lines tell one story: when the cost of living goes up, mental resilience goes down.
        It's not just a correlation — it's causation through lived experience. Housing insecurity means emotional instability.

      <h3>Scatter Plot – Rent vs Distress Correlation</h3>
      <p>
        Each dot represents a city. Larger rents mean higher distress scores.
        The near-perfect upward slope reveals how environment shapes emotion — location becomes a mental health factor.

        The data suggests that where you live determines not just your costs, but your calm.

      <h3>Bubble Chart – City Size vs Rent vs Distress</h3>
      <p>
        The bubble sizes emphasize scale — large, glowing circles for big cities where stress is concentrated.
        Students in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane carry the heaviest combined burden of cost and pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The smaller bubbles — Adelaide, Hobart — represent where affordability still allows breathing space.
        A visual metaphor: peace of mind shrinks with urban expansion.

      <h3>Box Plot – Sleep by Income Level</h3>
      <p>
        Sleep, the ultimate equalizer, becomes a privilege.
        Students earning less than $300 per week average under six hours of rest, while those above $500 reach eight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Income doesn't just buy comfort — it buys mental quiet.
