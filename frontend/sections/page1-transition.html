  <h2 class="fade-in">The Moment of Transition</h2>

  <!-- Intro Header -->
  <div class="intro-header fade-in">
    <p>
      Early university life often brings excitement but also subtle anxiety about fitting in, managing independence and meeting expectations.
      Research shows that even before classes begin many students already experience a psychological "shift."
    </p>
    <p>
      The freedom of new beginnings mixes with self doubt or pressure to perform and the fear of falling short.
      For many, university represents both the start of adulthood and the end of stability a place where ambition meets uncertainty.

      <h3>Excitement vs Anxiety</h3>
      <p>
        This chart reflects how optimism and anxiety often coexist in early adulthood.
        Around 78% of students feel excited to start university a symbol of independence, new friends and self-discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet 42% already report feeling anxious about finances and workload before their first semester begins.
        This contrast shows the emotional duality of transition: freedom paired with responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        While excitement fuels motivation, anxiety can quietly undermine focus and wellbeing.
        Students often compare themselves to others, feel uncertain about academic expectations or face family pressure to succeed.
        Over time, this anticipatory stress can set the tone for the semester ahead.

      <h3>1 in 3 Feel Constant Anxiety</h3>
      <p>
        The pictogram shows that one in three students experience constant anxiety not occasional nerves but ongoing tension that shapes daily routines.
        These students describe feeling "on alert," struggling to switch off and worrying about the future even during downtime.
      </p>
      <p>
        This finding underlines how emotional strain becomes normalised in academic settings.
        For many, it's not about one major event it's a steady accumulation of stress from small daily decisions, assessments and expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The transition to independence can amplify these emotions when combined with part-time work, social pressures and financial instability.

      <h3>Sleep Hours Before Semester</h3>
      <p>
        Sleep is one of the first casualties of independence.
        Survey data shows that a third of first-year students sleep fewer than 7 hours per night well below the recommended 8.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late-night socialising, part-time jobs and endless scrolling blur the boundary between rest and work.
        Sleep deprivation heightens stress, reduces memory retention and lowers emotional regulation all of which worsen anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ironically, students lose sleep not because of deadlines but because of anticipation the mental noise of "what if I fail?"
        The cycle begins even before assessments start.

      <h3>Optimism Index (2010 → 2025)</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past 15 years national student optimism has declined steadily.
        Between 2010 and 2015 rising enrolment and job growth kept spirits high.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as cost-of-living pressures, housing shortages and job insecurity increased, hope began to fade.
        The optimism line tells a generational story: today's students are more educated but less confident than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Economic uncertainty has eroded belief in long-term stability, replacing dreams of independence with survival mindsets.
        This decline is not just emotional it correlates with rising financial stress and reduced social connection.

      <h3>Stress Level Week 1–10</h3>
      <p>
        Tracking stress across the first 10 weeks reveals a consistent climb.
        Each week brings new demands including balancing coursework, adjusting to independent living and managing personal finances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stress peaks around mid-semester where motivation dips and academic pressure intensifies.
        This trajectory mirrors the psychological curve of adaptation and enthusiasm at the start, fatigue in the middle and resilience by the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, for many, resilience comes too late. Without early support or structured rest, chronic stress solidifies into burnout.
        The data reminds us that wellbeing isn't a fixed trait; it fluctuates with environment, community and purpose.
