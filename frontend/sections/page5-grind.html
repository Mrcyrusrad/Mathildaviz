  <h2 class="fade-in">The Grind: Survival Economy</h2>

  <!-- Intro Header -->
  <div class="intro-header fade-in">
    <p>
      The final form of adaptation is overwork.
      When money is tight and time is scarce, students sacrifice rest — not out of ambition, but necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This "survival economy" runs on caffeine and guilt: the pressure to work more to afford less.

  <!-- Section 1: Stacked Bar Time Use (Large) -->
  <div class="viz-section large fade-in">
    <div class="viz-text">
      <h3>Stacked Bar – Time Use Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        The bars show where student life disappears:
        35 hours for study, 25 for work, 40 for sleep, and just 10 for leisure.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is more than a schedule — it's a portrait of imbalance.
        Leisure and recovery shrink as work expands, leaving no margin for mental repair.

    <div class="viz-text">
      <h3>Run Chart – Energy Over Semester</h3>
      <p>
        A semester's energy curve starts high and collapses fast.
        By week 10, motivation runs dry — replaced by autopilot fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visual rhythm mirrors burnout: small drops, small recoveries, and then the crash.

  <!-- Section 3: Box Plot Burnout (Small) -->
  <div class="viz-section small reverse fade-in"}
    <div class="viz-text">
      <h3>Box Plot – Burnout by Employment Type</h3>
      <p>
        Students working full-time show the widest burnout range.
        Academic performance, mental health, and social connection all decline past the 25-hour mark.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data reinforces one truth: overwork doesn't build resilience — it dismantles it.
