  <!-- Intro Header -->
  <div class="intro-header fade-in">
    <p>
      Independence doesn't just cost effort it costs money.
      For most students, the first taste of adulthood comes with an invisible price tag. Rent, food, transport and textbooks stack up faster than paychecks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As wages stagnate and living costs climb, financial strain quietly becomes a defining part of the student experience.
      Behind the excitement of "freedom" is a daily calculation: Can I afford to study, eat and live this week?
    </p>
    <p>
      Economic stress is now one of the strongest predictors of poor mental health in young adults it doesn't just limit lifestyle, it reshapes wellbeing itself.

      <h3>CPI vs Rent vs Income Chart</h3>
      <p>
        The widening gap between living costs and student income paints a clear picture of imbalance.
        Since 2015, rent and CPI have risen by over 30%, while average student earnings have barely moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This mismatch traps many in cycles of debt and exhaustion forced to take extra shifts just to stay enrolled.
        Each upward tick on the rent line represents more than inflation; it represents time stolen from study rest and recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment the lines diverge is the moment wellbeing begins to decline.

        This area shows the pressure gap the distance between what things cost and what students can afford.
        That shaded space represents anxiety, side jobs, skipped meals and sleepless nights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time as the area widens, so does the emotional toll. Financial instability becomes a background hum in everyday life, eroding focus and confidence long before burnout appears.

      <h3>Pareto Chart Expenses Causing Stress</h3>
      <p>
        When students rank their biggest stressors, rent dominates, followed by food, transport and tuition.
        These categories aren't just numbers they reflect daily trade-offs: skipping social events, delaying healthcare, cutting back on groceries.
        Every dollar spent on rent is a meal skipped, every unpaid bill a source of quiet panic. 
        The Pareto chart exposes the imbalance between basic survival and mental stability: a student’s budget becomes a mirror of their stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rent, especially in major cities, becomes the psychological anchor for many it dictates everything else.

      <h3>Pie Chart Spending Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        This visual breaks down the reality of student budgets: rent consumes nearly half, leaving little room for savings or self-care.
        The smallest slice leisure represents how stress subtly replaces joy in the transition to adulthood.
        For most students, “discretionary spending” doesn’t mean luxuries it means laundry, public transport, or one small treat on payday. The smallest sliver, leisure, symbolizes more than the absence of spending it marks the absence of breathing room.
        This is the silent trade-off of independence: every expense is weighed against mental peace. The circle is complete, but the life it represents is fragmented.

      <h3>Weekly Budget Variance</h3>
      <p>
        Even small budget fluctuations an unexpected bill or a delayed payment can cascade into anxiety and sleep loss.
        The volatility of student income creates constant uncertainty, making long-term planning nearly impossible.
        Students describe the psychological toll of living one week ahead: the endless calculations, the anxiety before each bank notification. 
        Financial uncertainty creates a low hum of stress that never fully fades.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chart reveals how financial instability isn't just about low income it's about unpredictability.
        When you can't rely on consistent earnings, every expense becomes a potential crisis.
