    <p>
      What begins as financial worry soon becomes emotional fatigue.
Constantly calculating how to stretch a dollar rewires the mind into survival mode.
Students under chronic cost-of-living stress describe feeling ‚Äústuck in a loop‚Äù 
tired but unable to rest, busy but never caught up.

      <h3>Dual-Axis Line ‚Äì Rent vs Distress</h3>
      <p>
        Two curves rise together: housing costs and psychological distress.
        The data draws what words often hide emotional health declines as bills rise.
        From $350 to $640 per week, distress doubled from 28 % to 50 %.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each spike in the rent line is mirrored by a dip in wellbeing. Economic data rarely feels emotional, but here, it‚Äôs heartbreak quantified.

      <h3>Scatter Plot ‚Äì Rent vs Distress Correlation</h3>
      <p>
        Each dot represents lived experience a student balancing rent, study, and sanity.
        The correlation (r ‚âà 0.9) shows how cost directly maps to distress.
        For policymakers, it‚Äôs data. For students, it‚Äôs daily reality choosing between rent and rest, between paying bills or staying enrolled. 
        The pattern is clear enough to predict and that‚Äôs what makes it most tragic.

      <h3>Box Plot ‚Äì Sleep by Income Level</h3>
      <p>
        Sleep becomes the currency of privilege. The box plot reveals that students with higher incomes not only sleep longer but sleep better uninterrupted,
        worry-free. Lower-income students report fragmented rest, late-night shifts, and constant fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>
        This disparity doesn‚Äôt just affect alertness; it deepens inequality. Rested minds learn faster, cope better, and recover quicker.
        Exhausted minds make more mistakes, lose motivation, and burn out. Over time, the difference compounds exhaustion becomes a socioeconomic boundary.

      <h3>Bubble Chart City Rent vs Distress vs Population</h3>
      <p>
        Each bubble grows with rent and darkens with distress. Cities once seen as vibrant student hubs 
        Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane ‚Äî now pulse with quiet tension. Behind every high-rent postcode is a campus filled with tired, overworked, anxious students.
      </p>
      <p>
        In smaller cities, the bubbles shrink, and so does the psychological burden. The correlation is hauntingly consistent: the more you pay for your postcode, the less peace you can afford.
