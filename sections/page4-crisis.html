  <!-- Intro Header -->
  <div class="intro-header fade-in">
    <p>
      Housing instability is the silent epidemic beneath student life.
      Many are one missed payment away from relocation or homelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The places meant to feel safe rentals, share houses, student apartments often become sources of constant anxiety.
      Insecure housing isn't just about walls and roofs; it's about peace, privacy and belonging.

      <h3>Map % Income Spent on Rent</h3>
      <p>
        The map reveals an uncomfortable truth: in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, students spend over <b>50%</b> of income on rent.
        Financially, this is unsustainable; emotionally, it's devastating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each shaded region isn't just data it's a lived story of compromise, couch-surfing or staying in overcrowded flats.

      <h3>Bubble Map Rent vs Wellbeing</h3>
      <p>
      Each bubble grows with rent and darkens with distress. Cities once seen as vibrant student hubs Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane now pulse with quiet tension. 
      Behind every high-rent postcode is a campus filled with tired, overworked, anxious students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students in high-rent zones report loneliness and higher depressive scores a cost that doesn’t fit in spreadsheets.
        The cost of living has outgrown its category it’s no longer an economic issue, but a mental health one.

      <h3>Marimekko – Shared Housing vs Distress</h3>
      <p>
        This visualisation combines space and stress.
        As shared housing percentages rise, distress levels follow.
        In theory, shared housing should ease financial pressure. In practice, it transfers stress from money to people. 
        As shared living rates rise, so do distress levels a reminder that overcrowding can substitute one burden for another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing spaces brings community but also chaos. Privacy disappears and small conflicts amplify existing anxieties.

      <h3>Tree Map – Housing Type Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        The housing tree map shows how fragmented the student experience is: share houses dominate, solo living is rare and on-campus housing is inaccessible to many.
        Each block is a trade-off: safety for cost, independence for convenience. There’s no perfect option only shifting priorities.
        The structure of the map mirrors the mental state it depicts scattered, compressed, uneven. Housing reflects hierarchy, and for students, comfort sits at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each block tells a story of compromise trading security for affordability.

      <h3>Table – Rent/Income Ratio by City</h3>
      <p>
        When half your earnings go to shelter, the mind has little room to rest. Ratios falling from <b>0.55</b> to <b>0.42</b> still leave little slack.
        Numbers often feel cold, but this table burns quietly. Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane lead with ratios above <b>0.5</b>, half of every paycheck gone to rent. Even in more “affordable” cities, the figure rarely dips below <b>0.4</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ratio is a proxy for daily mental load: less leftover means less recovery.
