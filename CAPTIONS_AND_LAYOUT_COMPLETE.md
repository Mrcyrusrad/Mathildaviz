2. **Human Impact** - How does it affect students?
3. **Emotional Resonance** - Connect data to lived experience
4. **Concrete Details** - Specific numbers and examples
5. **Forward Motion** - Each caption builds the narrative

### **Tone by Page**
- **Page 1** - Hopeful but cautious
- **Page 2** - Sobering reality
- **Page 3** - Emotional weight
- **Page 4** - Crisis urgency
- **Page 5** - Exhaustion and strain
- **Page 6** - Recovery and hope
